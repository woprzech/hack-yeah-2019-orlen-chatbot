#### Description: 
<p>We have created Orlen Chatbot. Our solution is omni channel, since it contains both chatbot (available on website) and voicebot (you can just call him, e.g. in case of lack of internet connection).
                Both bots use same engine and knowledge base so learning one bot will enrich the second one in same time.
                Bot is able to answer some questions connected with employees, eg. how can I get funding for kids vacation, how much money will I get for my kids vacation, what types of benefits are available for employees.
                Our solution uses machine learning algorithms (via Rasa and Tensorflow) to recognize intent of sentences and to decide which answer should be provided for employee - there is no rule based engine, which makes our bot much more flexible and easier to extend and learn.
                We also created web interface for our chatbot. It contains landing page and history of current conversation.
                It allows bot to send him not only plain text but also some richer messages, e.g. with buttons which redirect user to website, buttons which call consultant and tables with some structured data. </p>
